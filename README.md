### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE  

**Fudan University** &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; September 2021 - June 2023  
*Researcher* **under Pro. Qi Ji**  
**Project: Analysis of functional differentiation of gene families in spatial transcriptome of mouse embryos**  
In this study, we applied spatial transcriptome technique combined with self-designed spatial dynamic programming method and short time series expression analysis. By integrating mouse embryo datasets at four stages with Stereo-seq data set, we located functionally differentiated gene families both spatially and temporally, such as the HOX gene.
- Conducted traditional spatial transtriptome data workflow: quality control; normalization; PCA/U-MAP/T-SNE dimensional reduction; our own clustering method not yet published; find marker gene; cell type annotation; pseudotime and cell trajectory analysis; GO/KEGG analysis.
- Designed our own spatial dynamic programming method to identify spatially similar or differentially expressed gene families.
- Attempted several short time series expression analysis such as STEM and mfuzz.

*Researcher* **under Pro. Qi Ji**  
**Project: A Spatiotemporal atlas of organogenesis in development of orchid flowers**    
In this study, we innovatively applied spatial transcriptome technique on the organogenesis in buds of orchid flowers. After conquering the difficulties of adjusting experimental conditions and identifying differentially expressed genes, We succeeded to reconstruct a convincing model of floral organ development.  
- Conducted traditional spatial transcriptome data workflow: Quality control; Normalization; PCA/U-MAP/T-SNE dimensional reduction; our own clustering method not yet published; Find marker gene; Cell type annotation; GO/KEGG analysis.  
- Focused on specific genes involved in floral organ development and observed their expression at different locations in different slices.    
- Applied Monocle3 to reconstruct flower development model and established a reasonable model.

*Researcher* **under Pro. Weidong Tian**  
**Project: Selecting the RNA Editing Sites in Gene Banks of Existing Species by Using Sprint**    
In this study, the sprint method independently developed by our lab was used to search for RNA editing sites in animals including rabbits, humans and chickens, which could identify RNA editing sites without consulting the SNP database of the species.  
- Collected and extracted the RNA sequencing results of each species from online; processed the RNA sequencing results to detect the readable RNA editing sites by applying Sprint.   
- Compared the RNA editing sites detected with the RNA editing sites detected by using other methodologies like JACUSA and GIREMI.  
- Selected some RNA tandem repeats with repeatability higher than 3 for different species to avoid misidentification as editable SNP sites.

*Researcher* **under Pro. Xiaohong Gong**  
**Project: Locating the Lesion Spot of Mentally Ill Person’ Brain based on Analysis of Gene Sequences and Neuro-brain Imaging**    
In this study, our goal was to provide new clues for pathway research of mental illness through studying the neuro-brain images and the samples of gene sequences from the clinical patients and detecting the relationship between the lesion spots and genotypes of different mental diseases.  
- Applied Matlab program to analyze the brain image; detected the most concentrated lesion area.  
- Successfully located the possible regions of pathogenic genes through correlation analysis.  
- Searched the possible gene pathway based on the lesion areas located to provide guidance for future research.
